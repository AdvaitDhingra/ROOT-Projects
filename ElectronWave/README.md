# Electron Wavelength

### In this project I used the Schr√∂dinger equation to plot the Wavefunction and the Amplitude of an Electron in a box.
To run this project just type in 
```shell
$ root electrons.c
```
You will be prompted to enter an energy level nx and ny. Enter an integer and admire the plot :D.
