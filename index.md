# This is a Github-Repo with some of the ROOT-Projects that I would like to show

## What is ROOT?
Root is a C++ Framework for Scientific Analysis, especially for lots of data. It was used to detect the Higgs Boson!

## My Projects:

- The first project is a simulation of the famous Young's Double Slit Experiment. I take a made-up wavelength (4 units in this case) and add that function with a Gausian Distribution to get the Interference Function. I then use this as a distribution to plot Electrons along the back wall. It also plots what you would see if you covered up one of the slits, which is no interference. It's all rather basic, so feel free to add some things.
- The second project plots the wavefunction and amplitude of a hypothetical electron in a 2d box. For this you obviously need a 3d graph, for which I use ROOT's TH2F Class. It's all quite straight forward.
- In the third project I plot the addition of two waves. This is extremly basic, but it's good to see how waves interfere.
- In the fourth project I plot the Mandelbrot set, which shows, given a complex number, if the fractal equation z = z^2, when iterated, blows up to infinity. It is quite stunning.
